    <!-- React ES6 Classes

    Classes -> A class is a type of function, but instead of uisng the keyword function to intitate it, we use the keyword class. and the properties assigned inside a constructor() method.

    Example ->

    A simple class constructor


    class Car{
    constructor (name) {
    this.brand = name;
    }
    } 
    -->
<!-- 
    <script>
      class  Car{
        constructor(name) {
          this.brand = name;

        }
      }

      const mycar = new Car("Audi");

      document.write(mycar.brand);
    </script> -->


       <!-- React ES6 Arrow Function


    Arrow function -> Arrow function is a shorter syntax for function which is often used as an expression b/c of
 -->
   <!-- //  Before Arrow Function //

    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <p id = "demo"></p>
    <script>
      hello = function(){
        return "Hello Mohit Welcome to ReactJs";
      }

      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = hello();
    </script>

    

    // With Arrow Function //

    <h1>Arrow Function</h1>

    <p id = "demo1"></p>

    <script>
      Mohit = () => {
        return "Hello Mohit Welcome to ReactJs";
      }

      document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = Mohit();
    </script> -->


        <!-- React ES6 Variables -->
<!-- 
    There are three ways of defining your variables: var, let, and const.

    var Variable ->
    
     1.if you use var outside of a function, it belongs to the global scope.
    2.if you use var inside a function, it belongs to that function.
3. if you use var inside a block i.e. a for loop, the variable is til available outside of that block.

    NOTE -> var has a function scope, not a block scope.

     -->
 
    <!-- let variable ->

    1. it declared inside a block of scope like for loop -->

    <!-- const variable ->

    1. const is variable that once it has been created its value can never change
2. const has blocak of scope.
    3. it does not define constant value. if define a constant refernce t a value.
  </body> -->

    <!-- React ES6 Array Methods -->
<!-- 
    One of the most useful in React  is the .map() array method.

    The .map() method allows you to run a function on each item  in the array, returning a new array as the result 

    In React , map() used to generate lists.
 -->

<!-- 
      React ES6 Destructuring -->
    
    <!-- for understanding destructuring we take example ->
     we'll make make aa sandwich. Do you take everything outof the refrigerator to make your sandwich? No , you only take out the items would like to use on yur sandwich. -->


  <!-- OLD WAY ASSIGNING ARRAY ITEMS

    const vehicles = ['car', 'truck', 'bike'];

    const car = vehicles[0];
    const truck = vehicles[1];
    const bike = vehicles[2]; -->

<!-- 
  NEW WAY ASSIGNING ARRAY ITEMS

    const vehicles = ['car', 'truck', 'bike'];

    const [car, truck, bike] = vehicles; -->

<!-- 
    EXAMPLE ->

    <p id= "demo"></p>
    <script>
      const vehicleOne = {
        brand: 'Ford',
        model: 'Mustang',
        year: 1969
      }

      myVehicles(vehicleOne);

      function myVehicles({brand, model, year}) {
        const message = 'My first vehicle was a ' + brand + ' ' + model + ' ' + year;

        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = message;
      }
